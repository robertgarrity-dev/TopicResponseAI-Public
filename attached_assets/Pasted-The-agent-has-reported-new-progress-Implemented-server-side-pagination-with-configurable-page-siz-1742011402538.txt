The agent has reported new progress: ✅ Implemented server-side pagination with configurable page sizes (5, 10, 20) ✅ Added pagination controls with next/previous and page number navigation ✅ Enhanced server startup logging for better debugging ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors in components ✅ Verified working in development environment
If everything looks good, I can start working on a new feature
The React frontend looks and works great. I'm getting an error on the WordPress frontend. Do I need to make changes to the WordPress frontend or was something missed on the NodeJS / Express side? DON'T MAKE ANY CODE CHANGES YET. Please just provide a reccomendation. frontend.js?ver=1.0:143 Error loading categories: TypeError: data.map is not a function

Looking at the WordPress frontend error, I can identify the issue. The error "TypeError: data.map is not a function" is occurring because the WordPress frontend expects the /api/topics endpoint to return an array of topics directly, but our recent pagination changes now return a structured object with { items, total, page, pageSize, totalPages }.

We have two options to fix this:

Update the WordPress frontend code to handle the new paginated response format
Add a compatibility endpoint or query parameter that returns just the array of topics for backward compatibility
I recommend option 2 (adding compatibility) because:

It's less disruptive to existing WordPress integration
We can maintain both formats without breaking either frontend
It follows the principle of backward compatibility
It's a simpler change that can be implemented server-side
Would you like me to proceed with implementing a backward compatibility solution for the WordPress frontend?
